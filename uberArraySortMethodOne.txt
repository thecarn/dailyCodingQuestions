/*
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

function product(array) {
  var newArray = []; 
  for (i=0; i < array.length; i++) {
    //initialize variable to hold total product from inputed array
    var product = 0;
    for (j=0; j < array.length; j++) {
      if(i === j) {
	//validates that the same number doesn't multiply itself
        continue;
      }
      if (product === 0) {
	//gives product a value from two numbers in array since product === 0
        product = (array[i] * array[j]);
      } else {
	//multiplies the product of every number before it to the next element in the array
        product = (product * array[j]);
      }
    }
    //divides the product of whole array by the element to ignore
    product = product / array[i];
    //inserts into new array 
    newArray.push(product);
  }
  return sortArrayAscending(newArray);
}
function sortArrayAscending(newArray) {
  newArray.sort(function(a, b){return a-b});
  return newArray;
}
function sortArraydescending(newArray) {
  newArray.sort(function(a, b){return b-a});
  return newArray;
}
console.log(product([1,2,3,4,5])); //expected output [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]
console.log(product([3,2,1])); // expected output [2,3,6]
